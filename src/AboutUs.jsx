      <h2>About The Verdant Nook</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2024, The Verdant Nook is born from a passion for bringing nature indoors.
        We believe that plants do more than just beautify a space; they bring life, tranquility,
        and a connection to the natural world. Our mission is to provide healthy, high-quality
        houseplants to enthusiasts and beginners alike, making it easy for everyone to create
        their own green sanctuary.
